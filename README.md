# C-GroceryList
A command line grocery list with add/remove functionality

This is a basic command line grocery list created by Sebastian Carman and Gerrit Wissink. The user inputs items to add and remove from the list through the terminal and exits the program using the EOF character. Before exiting, the program visually formats and prints the list created by the user.

Currently, the grocery list is built on an array, but it might be rewritten to run on a hash table in the future.
